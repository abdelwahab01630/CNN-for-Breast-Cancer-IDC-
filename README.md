# CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS

Early detection of breast cancer is essential for proper treatment of the illness. Often, radiologists
find it very difficult to diagnose the illness from the histopathology images of the patients, due to
the difficulty of interpreting the screening images correctly. Consequently, this may lead to a high
death rate among women, in general. Thus, we propose, an automatic breast cancer detection
system using artificial intelligence. More precisely, we have implemented a Convolution Neural
Network model from scratch. The trained model achieved a prediction accuracy of 84.44%.
Furthermore, transfer learning models such as Resnet-50 in particular has been applied to the
dataset, and resulted in a prediction accuracy of 94%.
